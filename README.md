## Target Audience
This learning module will be designed for elementary school children. We will introduce them to variables and explain how they are used to store values. We will also show them how to change the values of variables. We will not get into variable reassignment, just changes to initial assignment statments.

## Coding Interface
We will use restrictive HTML inputs to prevent syntax errors while the students are coding. Code will be presented in the following format: [variable name] = [variable value]; where the variable value is an HTML input like a text input or dropdown.

### Booleans
Booleans will use [dropdowns](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/select) with the following options: `true` and `false`.

### Numbers
Numbers will use [text inputs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input) with their `type` attributes set to `number`.

### Strings
Strings will use [text inputs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input) with their `type` attributes set to `text`.
